## Prerequisites

The script requires the following dependencies:

### Core Dependencies
- `curl` - For making HTTP requests to Plex API
- `sed` - For text processing
- `grep` - For pattern matching
- `date` - For timestamp handling
- `readlink` - For resolving symbolic links
- `xmllint` - For XML parsing (typically provided by libxml2-utils package)
- `bc` - For mathematical calculations (basic calculator package)
- `tee` - For logging output handling
- `python3` - For CSV processing
- `mktemp` - For temporary file handling
- `numfmt` - For number formatting (typically provided by coreutils package)
- `kill` - For process management
- `tr` - For character translation
- `wc` - For counting lines

### Package Installation

On Debian/Ubuntu systems, you can install missing dependencies using:
```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install curl coreutils bc python3 libxml2-utils
```

On Red Hat/CentOS systems:
```bash
sudo yum install curl coreutils bc python3 libxml2
```

Most Linux distributions will have many of these tools installed by default, but some might need to be installed manually.

## Installation

1. Download the script:
```bash
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jeremehancock/media-library-exporter/main/media-library-exporter.sh
```

2. Make it executable:
```bash
chmod +x media-library-exporter.sh
```

## Configuration

The script creates a configuration file at `config/media-library-exporter.conf` on first run. You can customize the following settings:

### Server Settings
```bash
# Plex server URL (required)
PLEX_URL="http://localhost:32400"

# Your Plex authentication token
# If set here, you won't need to pass it via command line
# See instructions above for finding your token
PLEX_TOKEN=""
```

### Connection Settings
```bash
# Number of retry attempts for failed API calls
RETRY_COUNT=3

# Delay between retries in seconds
RETRY_DELAY=5
```

### Export Settings
```bash
# Default output directory for exports
OUTPUT_DIR="exports"

# Date format for timestamps (uses date command format)
DATE_FORMAT="%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S"

# Force overwrite existing files (true/false)
FORCE=false
```

### Debug Settings
```bash
# Enable debug mode (true/false)
DEBUG=false

# Enable logging (true/false)
ENABLE_LOGGING=false

# Whether to run in quiet mode (true/false)
QUIET=false
```

The configuration file will be automatically created with default values on first run. You can modify these settings by editing the file directly or override them using command-line options.

## Usage

### Basic Usage

If you haven't set your Plex token in the config file:
```bash
./media-library-exporter.sh -t YOUR_PLEX_TOKEN [options]
```

If you've already set your Plex token in the config file:
```bash
./media-library-exporter.sh [options]
```

### Getting Your Plex Token

You can find your Plex authentication token (X-Plex-Token) using one of these methods:

1. Browser method:
   - Log into Plex Web App
   - Browse to a library item
   - Click the â‹® (three dots) next to the item
   - Click "Get Info"
   - Click "View XML"
   - Look at the URL in your browser's address bar - the X-Plex-Token will be at the end

2. Plex Desktop App method:
   - Open Plex Desktop App
   - Go to any library item
   - Right-click and choose "Get Info"
   - Click "View XML"
   - Find the X-Plex-Token in the URL
